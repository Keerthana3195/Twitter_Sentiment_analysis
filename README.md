### Twitter_Sentiment_analysis

In this project the idea was to fetch tweets using Twitter API and then apply the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) model on the tweets to see their sentiments. 

Sentiment Analysis is a text analysis method that is used to measure the sentiment or emotions (in terms of positive, negative or neutral) of a whole document, paragraph or a sentence. 

In this repository you will find the two code files and a sample csv file:
1. ExtractingTweets_twitterAPI.ipynb
2. Sentiment_analysis.ipynb
3. Vertiport.csv

The first one is used to fetch the tweets from the twitter API based on any keywords we want and the other helps to find the sentiments. The Vertiport.csv contains the sample data that I fetched using the keyword "Vertiport" from January 2015 to July 2022.
